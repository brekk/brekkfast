-------------------------

Additionally, the implementation in this repository (mersenne.js), is a VERY
heavily modified version of Stephan Brumme's version of the Mersenne Twister,
found here: https://create.stephan-brumme.com/mersenne-twister/

The license for that implementation is below.

2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be

3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.

-------------------------

It has already been stated, but bears repeating:

While this implementation is based on Stephan Brumme's code, it has been
very heavily modified - primarily for syntax, but also some small algorithm changes
to make it agree with the original C version from Matsumoto & Nishimura
